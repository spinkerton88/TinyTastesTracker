# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Tiny Tastes Tracker ("we," "our," or "the App"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile application and related services. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

## 2. No Medical Advice (CRITICAL DISCLAIMER)

**THE APP IS FOR INFORMATIONAL AND TRACKING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.**

- **Not a Substitute for Professional Care:** The content, tracking features, and AI insights provided by the App are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
- **Consult Your Pediatrician:** Always seek the advice of your physician or qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding your child's health, nutrition, or development.
- **Emergency Situations:** If you think your child has a medical emergency (including a severe allergic reaction), call your doctor or emergency services immediately.
- **Allergens:** While the App helps you track food introduction and potential allergens, relying solely on the App for allergy management is risky. Always follow your pediatrician's guidelines for allergen introduction.

## 3. User Accounts & Data

- **Account Creation:** You may need to create an account to use certain features. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
- **CloudKit Storage:** Your data is stored primarily on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We do not maintain a central database of your personal information.
- **Data Responsibility:** You are responsible for backing up your data (e.g., via iCloud Backup). We are not liable for any loss of data.

## 4. AI Features & Accuracy

- **Generative AI:** The App uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini) to provide recipe suggestions, serving ideas, and conversational answers.
- **Accuracy Not Guaranteed:** AI can hallucinate or provide inaccurate information. Always verify AI-generated advice with trusted sources or your pediatrician.
- **Photo Analysis:** Food recognition features are estimates and may not be 100% accurate. Do not rely on them for identifying critical allergens.

## 5. User Content

- **Ownership:** You retain ownership of any data, photos, or text you enter into the App ("User Content").
- **License:** By using the AI features, you grant us a limited license to process your User Content (e.g., sending text/photos to the AI provider) solely for the purpose of providing the service. We do not sell your content.

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:
- Use the App for any illegal purpose.
- Attempt to reverse engineer or tamper with the App's code.
- Use the App to harass, abuse, or harm others.
- Input false or misleading information that could compromise the safety of the tools (e.g., intentional misinformation about food safety).

## 7. Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part thereof) at any time with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the App.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TINY TASTES TRACKER AND ITS DEVELOPERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP; (B) ANY CONTENT OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APP; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 10. Usage by Minors

The App is intended for use by parents and legal guardians who are at least 18 years of age. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the App without parental supervision.
